            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two thinges eſpecially, that behoueth all good men to haue regarde of in this life. The one is the inlarging of the kingdome of Christ, to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost of their powers, in a lawfull and holy voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the other is ſimplicity and plainnes, in the places that God putteth men into, or in the words or workes, that he inableth them to performe therein. At both which things we our ſelues haue aimed (ſo farre forth as huma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e infirmytie would ſuffer) in the puliſhing of this preſent work, for the further decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof wee haue beene contented to prefixe theſe fewe lines. By Gods good prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the booke it ſelfe came into our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des from amongst the writings, of that religious &amp; worſhipful Gentlma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> M. <hi>Herlakinden</hi> of Kent, eſquier late deceaſed, and for whoſe cauſe onely (as we ſuppoſe) the penning of this was performed at the first: Which hauing once gotten into our handes, we could not let lie and periſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the wormes and moaths (as the prouerbe is) vnles we would cloſly &amp; vnder hand haue hindered the edification of the Church, but indeuour to our vttermoſt the publiſhing of the ſame. Wherein if any man thinke we did it, for glory or gaine vnto our ſelues, wee can not but tell them that as they doe vncharitably ſurmiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, ſo they doe fondly and fouly deceiue themſelues, as for glorye, how can we attayne, ſith the labor is wholy an others, and no part ours, except men would thinke vs to be ſo conceited that wee would count it credit to be decked with other birdes feathers, and to waxe rich with the robbery and vniust ſpoyles of others. And for gayne there is as litle, if not leſſe reaſon, for beſides that we know not what vent we ſhal haue, the ſale being very vncertaine, what likelyhood is there that our aduantage can be much, in publiſhing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries vpon that booke of which there are ſo many learned expoſitions extant already? And yet leaſt any ſhould imagine that we haue without cauſe, cauſed this to be printed, beſides the reaſons before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged we ſay, that both the ſoundnes of the matter it ſelfe, and the manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery obſerued therein, which is both plaine and ſhort (the one ſeruing for the more ſimple ſort of people, and the other fitting ſuch as either can not, or will not, allowe themſelues leaſure to read long commentaries) hath drawen vs on hereto. Wherein we do willingly giue al the world to vnderſtand, that we ſpeak not ſo much our own minds, for we confeſſe our ſelues to be men not greatly able to diſcerne of ſuch high points but we vtter that, that men of good countenance in the Church, &amp; of ſound iudgement, as in reſpect of religion, haue deliuered, and that we hope all that read it, ſhal well find and perceiue. There reſteth no more but this, that euery good man labour to referre it, to good ends and holy purpoſes, namely to the building vp of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues and others, in knowledge, in faith, in repentance and obedience of al ſuch good
<pb facs="tcp:173318:3"/> things, as God hath reueiled in his worde, praying the Godly reader, for his better &amp; more plain direction in that behalfe, diligently to obſerue theſe few points follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, First that all that is ſpoken, vppon all the Pſalmes or any of them, reſpecteth either the diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Pſalme it ſelfe into his members and parts, or the true ſenſe and natural meaning of the very words, or the doctrines, touching faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that are therein conteined. Secondly that whereſoeuer they ſhall finde, theſe letters, markes, or directions enſuing: i. vz. q.d. they would take paines to reſolue and interpret them thus, namely that, i. ſignifieth that it is to ſay, vz. ſignifieth to wit: and q.d. meaneth as if he ſhould ſay. Thirdly, that the framer of this work in all his notes, at the leaſt (for the moſt part we are ſure of it) had ſpeciall reſpect to that engliſh text of the Pſalmes and Bible that was Imprinted, at Geneua, which was as it ſhoulde ſeeme, the first yere of the raygne of our gracious Queene, which alſo we thought good to aduertiſe the reader of that ſo he may haue an eye always in his reading to, that text, or others conformable to the ſame, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vpon good authoritie, though it be not wholly put downe here, nor the wordes of it in other letters for difference ſake, as had been to be wiſhed. Laſtly wee are ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to intreat the godly reader, fauourably to interpret, and with loue to correct, whatſoeuer hath eſcaped here, through the negligence or ignorance of the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, imployed about this buſines, ſome taste whereof alſo euen we our ſelues haue thought good to giue vnto them, by putting downe ſome fewe ſcapes obſerued in the ouer reading of it, that ſo if there be any ſuch like (as we hope there are not many) they may by theſe amend the reſt. And thus beſeeching God to giue a bleſſing vnto this work in the heartes of all theſe into whoſe handes it ſhall come, we end the <hi>28.</hi> of Aprill. <hi>1586,</hi>
